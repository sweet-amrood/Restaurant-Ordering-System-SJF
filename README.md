This project is a Restaurant Ordering System that simulates the ordering process using the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. The system allows multiple customers to place orders, calculates their total bills, and processes orders based on burst time. Key features include displaying a menu with item details, handling customer orders, generating order summaries, and processing payments. The SJF algorithm ensures that orders with the shortest processing times are prioritized, enhancing efficiency in order management. This project serves as a practical example of applying scheduling algorithms in a real-world scenario.

The project folder also include the same project code using Peterson's algorithm instead of SJF.
